### intro

I'm Orta Therox, a developer/designer working on the TypeScript team.
 
After the new TypeScript website shipped, I took a week off to chill out and to study some of the principles for video editing my personal A/V setup.

I'd like to try talk through what I learned which helped me go from footage like this

[video]

to footage like this. This is a Rebase on my current A/V setup.

---- title card ----

I joined the TypeScript team as a remote engineer, the vast majority of the team is over in Seattle, and I'm here in NYC. 
This meant the vast majority of my interactions with the team would be via a webcam and Mic. 

Because of that, I grabbed a "Logitech C922x Pro Stream" webcam and a "Blue Yeti" Mic, the blue yeti worked out but I really didn't like the quality of the Logitech instantly. 

[Switch to logitech] In fact, here's what it looks like to use the logitech with the same lighting setup as I use today. It's just no capable of the quality I'd like to set as my lower baseline.[back]

So my current setup.

### Camera

The first and foremost, what camera do I use? I use a DSLr, this one is the Canon EOS 250D or the Canon Rebel 3. When I started looking for a camera, this Canon was considered one of the cheapest high end cameras which could record high quality 4k video. 

I wanted to use this camera as a webcam, so I use a HDMI capture card to support turning the camera's monitor output (a.k.a. the back screen) into a camera a computer understands

[show photobooth] This decision isn't without its downsides, the video is sent at 720, after 30 minutes the camera shutter turns off and [change settings] you can't have auto-focus on or you get a box around your head. That said, this is definitely good enough for using as a webcam, just not for recording a video like this.

I don't have much advice on your camera other than find something in your price range, adn verify  it works with camlink ahead of time. Who knows, maybe the next generation of dLSRs will take being a webcam seriously now that so many people are working from home. 

So, in recording a video like this, I just hit the record button on the camera to record the footage then take that footage into my video editor manually. Hitting record won't stop it being a webcam, so I can still see my footage on the computer which is pretty nice as a reference.

### Audio

I started with a blue yeti and I ended with a blue yeti, what changed the most was the yeti settings, the structure of my office and how I positioned the mic physically.

The blue yeti has two options to configure, "gain" and "pattern". A lot of the internet recommended putting gain to the lowest possible, and then solving that with audio-editing. I recorded a few videos like this and it sounded rough. I made a series of experiments and settled on gain at 1/3rd and only a tiny amount of editing. 

Then I use the cardioid mode, the heart shape which basically means a close single direction, so you need to have the yeti logo facing you for it to pickup right.

Then because my office is a big white room with no windows, I started moving posters and items to break up the echo behind me, and in front of me on the other side of my screens are a bunch of couch cushions which act as a pretty reasonable acoustic foam.

To get the best audio from me, I switch to a kneeling chair I was given when someone left Artsy - when I was in a band we noticed that the a recording just felt better if I was standing, so we always did that. This kneeling chair provides a reasonable equivalent by forcing good posture, and it's also silent.

Finally, I gave up on the default mic stand for the blue yeti and either use a random stand we had laying around or I sit it on a cushion like today. The goal is to not have it touching the desk to avoid keys and mouse clicks during webcams or streaming. 

### Lighting

Next up is the room lighting, the common pattern which I mostly enjoy is to set up two lighting scenes - the background and the foreground.

For the background I bought some $5 coloured light bulbs from a hardware store, then I augmented that with a Philips Hue light strip. The cheaper light bulbs aren't strong but they provide a nice non-white colour to mix with. The background wants to be dark, I'm still not sure _how_ dark but it's a balancing act.

For the foreground I have three main light sources, two of them are my computers screens. On one of the screens I use a design tool to fill the monitor with colour, you can see how they affect [right hand side]this side: 

 - here's white
 - here's black
 - here's some other oclours

Then I have another philips hue for the foreground which acts a bit like a room flood light, this is just a normal ikea lamp with the light bulb. 

I can use the philips hue mobile app to change this lighting, so here's [x,y,z]

By treating the BG and FG as different domains of light you can capture that 'knows what they're doing feel' and give yourself some space for experimentation.

### Software

I edit with Screenflow, I've used Screenflow since 2011 - it does a good job of the simple stuff and generally lets you be able to do the complex editing stuff. It's Mac only, but it's got that 'built-for-one-platform' flair as a side effect.

### Scripting

I write the majority of my scripts ahead of time, there's a GitHub repo you can see them on. The scripts generally provide a framework for how I speak and I allow myself to amend on the spot. I'd rather it feel more natural than forced, in party because I want it to feel more like a discussion where the other person is just nodding silently then a formal conference style talk. There's got to be some element of unpolished there to add a sense of authenticity, I'm just someone making a video on saturday morning before the rest of the house gets up and maybe turns on the A/C - I'm not a slick full-time youtuber.

### Eyes

I noticed in my first few videos that I was struggling with eye contact, so I shifted the positioning of the camera and where my current notes are, they live right next to each other physically now. so while you'll still see me looking [this way] occasionally to pretty often, that lets me have less editing and cutting sessions and a closer. I use an apple mouse to scroll these notes while I talk because it's silent and I don't need to find a scrollwheel.

### Wrapup

So that's my general setup - to get a setup like this is like 120 for the mic, 550 ish for the camera, 120 for the camlink  and around 150 for lighting. So it comes in at just over 1000 dollars. Looking this casual just aint that cheap. For me at least, this has been incrementally bought over a year or more.

If price is a blocker for you, I bet there are cheaper and close enough options on the mic, camera and lighting but I don't think you can avoid using a HDMI capture card. 

In my week off, I recorded a lot of experiments which I deleted
