I'm Orta Therox, a developer/designer working on the TypeScript team.

I've been writing code across many platforms for about 15 years. Let's politely call the first 5 years of that a write-off. Which means I have shipped about 10 years of useful professional code. It's hard to quantify how much of that code is still running or even can run today without work.

In the industry this is known as code rot, and I want to try dive into some of the reasons why good code stops working.

---- intro ----

## How Does Un-Touched Code Rot?

Working on a software project is always about treading a balance between two major conflicts: Doing stuff and making it easy to do stuff over time. We tend to think of it in terms of 'features' vs 'tech debt'.

Software can grow eternally as a program grows to fully explore the design space for it's original goals, and that design space can expand as you see new horizons. 

For example, I doubt Linus was thinking about the ubiquity of android smart phones when Linux was starting to rattle around in his head and that the same project would be powering virtual apps inside virtual servers in containerized data-centers running under the sea. 

This trade-off can make figuring out what abstraction level you want to be working at a real struggle because you often want to be working a the highest level of abstraction possible - but the more layers of indirection you use, the more space there is for things to change without your influence.

That to me is one of the core idea when thinking about code-rot: at what point, does every abstraction you use, stop paying for itself.
