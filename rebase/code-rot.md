I'm Orta Therox, a developer/designer working on the TypeScript team.

I've been writing code across many platforms for about 15 years. Let's politely call the first 5 years of that a write-off. Which means I have shipped about 10 years of useful professional code. It's hard to quantify how much of that code is still running or even can run today without work.

In the industry this is known as code rot, and I want to try dive into some of the reasons why good code stops working.

## How Does Un-Touched Code Rot?

Working on a software project is always about treading a balance between two major conflicts: Doing stuff and making it easy to do stuff over time. We tend to think of it in terms of 'features' vs 'tech debt'.

Software can grow eternally as a program grows to fully explore the design space for it's original goals, and that design space can expand as you see new horizons. 

For example, it's pretty unlikely that someone imagined emoji support when arguing about how to build ASCII. Or, I doubt Linus was thinking about the ubiquity of android smart phones when Linux was starting to rattle around in his head or that people would be running virtual apps inside virtual servers in containerized data-centers running under the sea. As the scope of the project changed, so did the expectations of features inside the kernel.
