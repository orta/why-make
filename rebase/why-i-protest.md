### intro

I'm Orta Therox, a developer/designer working on the TypeScript team.
 
I believe that programming is a social sport, and one of the most useful skills you can have as a programmer is empathy. 
The last 4 years have been particularly challenging for an empathetic folks. 
As a Brit living in America, in 2016 I felt the double whammy of the Brexit shitshow and the deeply disappointing rise of Trump in America. 
These aren't 'the start' of the democratic backsliding in the west, but they are both a tent-pole events which make it pretty obvious what's going on.

I've documented my general feelings on these changes over the years in my annual write-ups, but TLDR: it sucks and it's been hard to be anything but apathetic to these nations just getting worse. Here's the thing though, I'm a literal 10%er (like, globally) - at Microsoft, I make somewhere around $300k a year - that's a lot of money, which means I get the ability to just skip so many of life's worries.

I donate a pretty solid chunk amount of my money to charities, family and friends, but like a lot of rich people - I just kinda save it for a "one day I might find a good use for this" because me and Danger don't have kids nor expensive habits. 

This year's coronavirus response being terrible in England and America wasn't a surprise given the populist leadership, but genuinely surprised me was the response to the murder of George Floyd. The day after the first protest, a Artsy friend reached out in our alumni slack saying he was going to break the lockdown to go out and I realised that I just couldn't stay at home anymore.

And so this rebase, is what motivates me to go out and protest.
