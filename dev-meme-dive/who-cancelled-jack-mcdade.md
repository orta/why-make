Hi, I'm Orta Therox - a developer/designer working on the TypeScript team at Microsoft. If you like these videos, you can sponsor my work on GitHub Sponsors. I'm a pretty active reader of twitter and an occasional writer, and have been thinking about deep dives into interesting trends I've seen lately.

My last video was about whether people should dog-pile on bad twitter takes, and I argued that most of the time quote-tweet dog piles don't really help anyone and mainly seem to be virtue signaling with a mix of making yourself feel better. 

This week however, an interesting case-study just came up, of someone choosing to self-immolate on Twitter via their blog.

[title]

Back in May I was introduced to Jack McDade though his website: https://twitter.com/orta/status/1262491917553668103

I started following him because he had been doing some good, interesting design work. I unfollowed a few months after - I generally don't want to follow accounts which feel too self-marketing-y and are always too chipper. It just doesn't feel inauthentic, as a reasonably cynical Brit. 

On tuesday, Jack, in a coming-out style post, announced to the world that he was "voting conservative". Given that the US is a two party system, at generally about 50/50 split then this shouldn't necessarily need a reveal post..

Honestly, I can't think of any tweets/posts before where someone felt the need to reveal themselves at this, so it's a bit of a first time for me. 

Let's first try to contextualize Jack, and this post. Unlike the previous two tweeters, Jack has shipped 40,000 tweets - only a few hundred more than me - and seems to live off his Twitter brand, definitely knowing how to play the meta of being a content creator on the internet.

His post starts off with how he has to hide his beliefs, and that he expects to be cancelled for this post. He's going to tell us what he believes. That prosperity comes from hard work and self-discipline and small businesses are the backbone of the economy. That the church lost its way, and that he needs to vote for a party which aligns with his beliefs and values. He thinks the democratic party seek to divide kds from their parents, and fights for the right to kill unborn children. He believes the democrats want to maintain an unconstititional separation of church and state and wants to fill positions of power with non-christians. He knows people may cancel him for these beliefs and he says it all with love, and wishes everyone would see the world through his god. 

Now, to be explicit, this isn't a take-down video going through the points of his post. I'm more interested in the central themes of what made it viral. There are two main components to this post which I think gave it fuel for the fire: Ignorance and Religion

### Ignorance

Ignorance, a lot of this post is just plain wrong. Which in some contexts can be fine, the internet is full of ignorant posts and few get this level of backlash.  What raises its profile is some really bad phrasing and maybe unfinished ideas.
 
  - He says "every life matters" which is a phase which evokes the racist dog-whistle of "all lives matter". Given the daily protests around Black Lives Matter and policy brutality, this is just tone deaf writing.

  - Saying the democrats "create a divide between kids from their parents" is just plain dumb in the context of the Republican's goals with immigration
 
 - He argues that rights for "unborn children" - which is just weaselwords for the idea abortion rights are more important than the rights of actual living people.

 - Calling the separation of church and state un-consititional is just plain wrong

Writing an ignorant post doesn't always necessitate viral-ity, but being factually wrong on the US election day, on a topic which is quite literally life or death for people, is definitely setting a target on your back.

### Religion

All of his arguments in this post are backed up by his religious beliefs. Now, I'm an atheist, but my mother started a foodbank in a church, set up homeless shelters, built pay-what-you-can cafes and is now an ordained reverend. She's a church leader in one of Britain's biggest cities. I know what an empathetic Christian looks like. So do a lot of other people, republican's ain't it.

I think the developer sphere is generally pretty atheistic, but being outwardly religious in developer circles isn't asking for trouble. I work with folks who include their religion in their twitter bios, and there are high profile folks who treat their religion as an important part of their online identity. For example, Henry Zhu of Babel has a great podcast called Hope in Source on faith and open source, and Jon Reid of qualitycoding regularly interweaves spirituality with his conference talks.

Unlike the previous tweets we looked at: Jack has been writing on the internet for a long time and knew the game he was playing - he declared he would probably be cancelled at the start and end. I don't think these cases should be treated the same. There's a difference in someone making a one-off un-intended/misinformed tweet and someone consciously putting inflammatory material out there.

This makes it super disappointing when someone who looked like they were on the ball, publicly states their ignorance, and wraps it up in a religious bow.  So, who cancelled Jack McDade? Well, he did. Knowingly.

## So, what can we learn from this? 

The day job of a developer is literally figuring out logical errors in each others code and trying to build systems based in impartial knowledge.

Any group has cultural norm, and generally speaking in tech you are assumed to be left-leaning, logical, empathetic and well informed. 

If you know that you're writing something which is certainly going to rile people up and goes against these norms, then your writing requires a lot more nuance and fact-checking ahead of time. 

Making sure that you have linked sources, and can link to sources to help people understand how you came to these conclusions. In this post, Jack did none of that and I'm not particularly shocked by the outcome of his writing.

I personally believe that Jack's write-up portrayed him as a fundamentalist christian who uses religious dogma to hide behind a voting for a bigot. There's a chance he's not racist, sexist or classist but by stating how he voted, he's saying those things are not blockers for him and that's disappointing.
