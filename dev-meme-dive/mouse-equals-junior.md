This week _oshell (either o shell or os hell) went from a pretty normal account of a few hundreds twitter followers to a few thousand by posting a tweet which a lot of developers disagreed with. https://twitter.com/_oshell/status/1312206331277840384

This sort of thing tends to happen regularly, a month ago it was "What's stopping you from coding like this?" ( https://twitter.com/haysstanford/status/1306209477226569729 ) which asks someone "why don't you work everyday?" as shown by a GitHub contribution graph. This is the contribution graph for Fabien Potencier, https://github.com/fabpot he's got a solid cadence of working on OSS every day and occasionally runs some tooling which makes a lot of commits resulting in a pretty obscene amount of commits in a year. His actual pattern of working is not dissimilar to my own, but I don't have the days with hundreds of commits - so my colours scheme is a bit indicative of how much time/effort to OSS I put in that day.

This week's tweet hit a nerve for very obvious reasons: it punches down and gate-keeps. By exclaiming that if you use a mouse you must be a junior developer, the tweet plays into the trope that only successful or experienced people do x. Which is a recipe for people who are successful or experienced (by whatever metric they choose) want to offset the potential damage for those who might see the tweet. 

Programming is a hard craft, and the onboarding years are tough. It's pretty easy to imagine someone working through their first year of programming thing just isn't for them if they've been struggling for a while now and the idea of not using a mouse wasn't on their radar.

I think what makes this tweet stand out, is that it has a strong amount of truth to it - one of my first blog posts back in 2011 was about all the key commands I had learned for my daily workflow, and I ran multiple workshops at my last job specifically on teaching the shorts for common tasks in everyday tools which non-programmers use. There is an element of technical fluency involved in preferring keyboard shortcuts instead of the mouse: they are quicker, less ambiguous and can be consistent across applications.

I still use a mouse pretty regularly, I got a new mouse on this month after decades of only using an apple magic mouse, and I'm definitely a successful and experienced programmer. However, my success and experience are not tied to my ability to use keyboard shortcuts. They won't be for any programmer.

This tweet could have the exact same idea but re-written as "If you're a junior looking to be a better developer, try exploring learning new key-commands" - same energy, different tone, not gate-keeping. However, that is a bland and generally forgettable tweet. 

The thing that made this viral is the responses from others dog-piling, and that I think people who did reply to this tweet should probably be looking at themselves and wondering "why did I put this in-front of my followers?" - in dog-piling, and directly responding, was I helping? Especially when _oshell made it pretty obvious they considered it a mistake tweet in their replies which show up first.

Twitter doesn't have an edit button, or a way to annotate a tweet as a mistake and the people who amplified this bad tweet did just that - they amplified it. Amplifiying the tweet gave the author a whole new set of followers too by the way, probably not the set of followers they want, but the numbers went up considerably and so does the incentive for them and others to do it again.

People who are exploring the medium of twitter will always make mistakes, but I think the folks with more than a thousand followers should think about their responsibility in dog-piling on bad takes. So here's my advice for these cases:

 - Never link back to the original tweet
 - Write an original tweet if you want to offer a counter argument with useful resources: for example "I use a mouse all the time in programming, but I think there's value in learning in key commands - here's some resources" - is that a boring tweet? Yes, but its more net value good than the a spicy reply
 - Undermine the original point, which is what I did with the "what's stopping you from coding like this" contrbutions graph generator.

Friction gets followers, and even if you're on the "right side" you're still providing the fuel for that fire.
