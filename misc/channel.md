Hey folks, I'm orta therox - a developer / designer currently working on the TypeScript team at Microsoft. 

For the last 15 years, I've worked on cool projects like iOS Apps, dependency managers, re-designing homepages for popular tools, building a lot of glue code and building a system for creating cultural linters. 

I've been in the top 20 most active GitHub users for the last 7 years, which means I have read and written a lot. This provides a nice focal point for this YouTube channel which tend to revolve around why and how people build the tools developers use everyday. 

I'll always be examining from a 'assume positive intent' focus, while friction gets followers - I think in the long run a bit of nuance is useful.

So! If you enjoy my open source work, maybe you can sponsor me on GitHub? Otherwise like and subscribe and leave a comment of :+1:
